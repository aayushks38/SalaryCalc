## ✨ Overview

Most students receive placement offers in terms of **CTC (Cost To Company)**.

However, the actual amount credited to their bank account every month is often significantly lower due to:

- Provident Fund (PF)
- Income Tax
- Bonus Components
- Variable Pay Structures

**SalaryCalc** bridges that gap by providing a clean and intuitive way to estimate real take-home compensation.

## 🧮 Salary Formula

### Fixed Pay

```js
fixedPay = annualCTC - annualBonus;
```

### PF Deduction

```js
pfDeduction = fixedPay * (pfPercentage / 100);
```

### Tax Deduction

```js
taxDeduction =
(fixedPay - pfDeduction) *
(taxPercentage / 100);
```

### Annual In-Hand

```js
annualInHand =
fixedPay -
pfDeduction -
taxDeduction;
```

### Monthly In-Hand

```js
monthlyInHand =
annualInHand / 12;
```
